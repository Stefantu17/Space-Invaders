This game was created as my grade 11 computer science summative assignment.

## Objective 
Our game will be our version of the classic game [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders). The premise of the game is to be able to destroy all the enemy space invaders while dodging their attacks and maintaining up to 3 lives. The game will have user input that includes mouse clicks to start the game and arrow keys to control your ship. Players will be able to move and shoot simultaneously.

## Mechanics
Mouse will be needed to start the game as well as your A, D, left arrow, right arrow keys to move your ship during the game. Keyboard input will determine where the ship moves, altering where the ship shoots and how it will dodge enemy shots. Space key will be used to shoot a bullet at the aliens. Our program impliments handling multiple keys.

## Scoring
Scoring is tallied on how many enemy space invaders you destory. The more you destroy, the higher the score goes up per space invader destroyed. A bonus is also awarded for each fleet of space invaders you defeat. Rack up as many points as you can with the lives you are given and reach for a new high score!

## Limitations
Some limiations to our program include only being able to shoot 1 bullet at a time, enemy can only counterattack with 1 bullet back, and only 1 respawn pattern for the aliens.
